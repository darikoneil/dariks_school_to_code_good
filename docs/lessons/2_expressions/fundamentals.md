# Expressions

Recall, from the introduction lesson, that a program is made up of instructions 
(operators, functions, methods) that manipulate variables & data structures stored 
in memory and some logic that determines the order of execution (control flow). These 
instructions can be broadly categorized into **expressions** and **statements**.

`1. Expressions`
:   An expression is a piece of code that the programming language **evaluates** to 
produce a value. Expressions are the building blocks of programs: they combine values,
variables, operators, and function calls to compute results that programs use or store.

`2. Statements`
:   A statement is a complete instruction that performs an action, such as assigning 
values to variables or controlling the flow of execution. Statements may contain 
expressions, but their primary purpose is to **do** something rather than to produce 
a value.

!!! Tip "Expressions vs. Statements"

    Expressions *are* something, statements *do* something.
