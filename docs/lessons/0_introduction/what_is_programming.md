# What is Programming?
Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can understand 
and execute. These instructions, known as code, are written in programming languages 
such as Python, Java, or C++. Programming allows us to create software applications, 
websites, games, and more by providing the computer with a set of rules to follow.
