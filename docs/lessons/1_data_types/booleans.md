# Boolean Data Types

Boolean data types represent one of two possible values: `true` or `false`. They are 
commonly used in programming and logic to indicate the truthiness of a statement or  
condition. Booleans are essential for determing the sequence of execution in 
programming, allowing for decisions to be made based on certain criteria.

=== "Python"
    ```python
    is_raining = True
    has_umbrella = False
    ```

=== "MATLAB"
    ```matlab
    isRaining = true;
    hasUmbrella = false;
    ```
