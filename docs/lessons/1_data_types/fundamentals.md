# Fundamentals of Data Types

Data types are a fundamental concept in programming that define the kind of data a  
variable can hold. They determine how data is stored, manipulated, and interpreted 
by  the computer. Bits and bytes are the basic units of data storage in computer  
systems. A bit is the smallest unit of data, representing a binary value of 0 or 1.  
A byte consists of 8 bits and can represent 256 different values (2^8). Data types 
are built upon these basic units to represent more complex information.
