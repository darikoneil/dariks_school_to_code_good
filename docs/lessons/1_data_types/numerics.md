# Numeric Data Types
Numeric data types are used to represent numbers in programming. They can be broadly 
categorized into two main types: integers and floating-point numbers.

## Integer Types
Integer types represent whole numbers without any fractional or decimal component.

They can be further divided into:
- **Signed Integers**: Can represent both positive and negative values. Examples include:
  - `int8`: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
  - `int16`: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
  - `int32`: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
  - `int64`: 64-bit signed integer (-large number to large number)

- **Unsigned Integers**: Can only represent non-negative values. Examples include:
  - `uint8`: 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255)
  - `uint16`: 16-bit unsigned integer (0 to 65,535)
  - `uint32`: 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4,294,967,295)
  - `uint64`: 64-bit unsigned integer (0 to large number)

## Floating-Point Types
Floating-point types are used to represent real numbers that have a fractional component.

- float16: 16-bit floating-point number (half precision)
  - float32: 32-bit floating-point number (single precision)
  - float64: 64-bit floating-point number (double precision)
