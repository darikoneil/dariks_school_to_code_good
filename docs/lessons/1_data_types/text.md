# Textual Data Types

Textual data types are used to represent and manipulate text-based information.  In 
programming, text is typically represented using strings, which are sequences of  
characters. Textual data types are essential for handling user input,  displaying 
messages, and processing natural language.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    greeting = "Hello, World!"
    g = chr(65)  # Character 'A'
    ```

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    greeting = 'Hello, World!';
    g = char(65); % Character 'A'
    ```
