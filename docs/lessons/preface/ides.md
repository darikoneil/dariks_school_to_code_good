# Integrated Development Environments

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides
a comprehensive application for software development. An IDE typically includes a 
code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs also offer features like 
code completion, syntax highlighting, static analysis, and version control integration.

## Python

Popular IDEs for python development include:
1. **VS Code**: A lightweight, open-source IDE developed by Microsoft 
    that supports a wide range of programming languages through extensions.
2. **Visual Studio**: A full-featured IDE also developed by Microsoft, 
    primarily for .NET and C++ development (but supports many other languages).
3. **PyCharm**: An IDE developed by JetBrains specifically for Python development, 
    offering advanced features like code analysis and web development support.
4. **Jupyter**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share 
     documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
5. **Spyder**: An open-source IDE oriented towards data analysis and visualization.
6. **Notepad++**: A text editor often used for coding with support for syntax 
   highlighting. Generally used by the elderly or for quick edits.

!!! tip

    Visual Studio and PyCharm are generally preferred by professional developers 
    due to their robust feature sets and support for large-scale projects.

## MATLAB

MATLAB is shipped with its own built-in IDE, which is tailored for engineering
applications (though with limited support for general-purpose programming).
